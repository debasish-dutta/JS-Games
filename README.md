# A website comprising of JavaScript games starting from basic games to advanced games.

This is a repo of a basic website created with html-css-js and is about me practicing basic javascript concept by building basic
games like tic-tac-toe, rock-paper-scissors and connect four. I will also add more complex games as I go and practice more.

Have to add some more functionalities to the basic. It is now just the working version.

* tic tac toe: css cleaning up

* rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock: addition of AI animations

* connect four: complete the winning array
